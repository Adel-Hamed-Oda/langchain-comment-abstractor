NOTE: for the app to work you need to put your own API key in the main.py file so that it can communicate with OpenAI successfully

Features to Add:
- Wrapping code in a class to avoid the usage of globals
- Adding extra UI elements to make it more user-friendly
- Writing the output to a new file of the user's choosing instead of overwriting the old one
- use Json to send and receive data instead of strings
- show errors as GUI instead of printing them in the console
- allow the user to redo the process after success instead of closing the program
- make the API key input into a GUI element and save it in a local file for future access
