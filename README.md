NOTE: for the app to work you need to put your own API key in the main.py file so that it can communicate with OpenAI successfully\n
\n
Features to Add:\n
-- Wrapping code in a class to avoid the usage of globals\n
-- Adding extra UI elements to make it more user-friendly\n
-- Writing the output to a new file of the user's choosing instead of overwriting the old one
-- use Json to send and receive data instead of strings
-- show errors as GUI instead of printing them in the console
-- allow the user to redo the process after success instead of closing the program
-- make the API key input into a GUI element and save it in a local file for future access
